\end{tabular*}      	  
\end{figure}

Firms that exit the market are, on average, 2.7 years older than the firms that stay in the market. As can be seen in \autoref{tab:exitstats}, the differences in distribution suggests that firms that leave the market have less capital and investment, similar labor, and higher output. \\
The fact that exiting firms have higher output is puzzling. However, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:time}, after year three, exiter firms seem to have tried to compensate for a bad productivity draw by increasing labor and investment. However, this overspending drove them to leave the market.

\subsection*{Question 2}
In order to estimate technology from a production function, we need the best possible estimates of the $\beta$s in the main regression because everything that we don't accurately account for in terms of labor, capital, and firm characteristics will go in the error which will ultimately be the estimate of technology. We expect the labor coefficient to be positively biased given the simultaneity between a flexible input and output. Regarding capital, we expect it to suffer from both attenuation bias and negative bias. First, because of capital measurement error. Second, because of selection, since we are focused solely on the firms that stay.  \\

Suppose the errors in equation 1 can be rewritten as $\eta_{it}=\varepsilon_{it}+\eta_{i}$. If the unobserved time-invariant component $\eta_{i}$ is not correlated with the regressors, estimates from the fixed-effects model are consistent but inefficient relative to estimates from the random-effects model.
In this case, the results for the pooled, fixed, random, and between effects  are shown in \autoref{tab:q2}. As can be seen in column (1), it is the case that the coefficient of labor is larger than the standard 0.3 in the US literature. Likewise, capital seems less that then benchmark of 0.6.


the crucial distinction between within and random effects is whether the unobserved individual firm effect embodies elements that are correlated with the regressors in the model, not whether these effects are stochastic or not

In this case, the interpretation of sigma u in the coefficient table is the same for the fixed-effects and random-effects models. However, sigma u is a nuisance parameter when x is correlated with the covariates.

\subsection*{Question 5}

The coefficient obtained for labor here is similar to the one obtained in the question above, suggesting that endogeneity might not be such a big concern. 

\subsubsection*{(c)}
\input{../out/table_question5c.tex}
\FloatBarrier
Comparing our results to the ones found in questions 2 and 4, we can see that the coefficient for capital (0.271) is lower than the one found in the all four specifications analyzed in question 2. The same applies to question 4. As expected, all coefficients are positive -- firms that suffer higher productivity shocks hire more capital. 
With respect to the coefficient for age of the firm (0.147), we verify the opposite. All coefficients found in questions 2 and 4 are lower for age than the one we found in the second-stage, but the differences are not as stark as for the capital case. 
This seems to suggest that endogeneity is a concern for the coefficient of capital. In addition, this model should also correct for measurement error.  
\newpage
\subsubsection*{(d)}
\input{../out/table_question5d.tex}
\FloatBarrier
After correcting for selection, our coefficient for capital rises, while the one for age decreases. 
This result makes sense, as selection should lead to a negative bias in the capital coefficient.

The results are very similar to what was found before. The steps we went through before were simply a decomposition of this command.
